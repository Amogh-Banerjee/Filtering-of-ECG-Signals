% Butterworth Highpass filter designed using FDESIGN.HIGHPASS.

% All frequency values are in Hz.
Fs = 250;  % Sampling Frequency

Fstop = 0.1;         % Stopband Frequency
Fpass = 0.5;           % Passband Frequency
Astop = 60;          % Stopband Attenuation (dB)
Apass = 3;           % Passband Ripple (dB)
match = 'passband';  % Band to match exactly

% Construct an FDESIGN object and call its BUTTER method.
h  = fdesign.highpass(Fstop, Fpass, Astop, Apass, Fs);
Hd = design(h, 'butter', 'MatchExactly', match);
